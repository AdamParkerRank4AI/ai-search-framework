Version 3.4

Overview

The AI Search Framework is a structured methodology for improving how businesses are interpreted and recommended inside generative AI systems.

It focuses on AI SEO visibility and recommendation stability across platforms including:

ChatGPT
Google AI results
Claude
Gemini
Perplexity

This framework does not optimise for traditional search rankings.
It governs interpretive clarity and inclusion probability inside AI generated answers.

Foundational Assumptions

AI systems do not rank pages in isolation.
They interpret entities across probabilistic graphs.
They retrieve passages through vector segmentation.
They prefer structured, compressible information.
They cross reference identity externally.
They weigh consistency across time.
They favour verifiable claims over assertions.

Recommendation likelihood increases when interpretive variance decreases across:

Identity
Subject
Structure
Format
Evidence
Ecosystem
Time

Core Signal Model

The framework is structured around five strategic layers.

1. Identity Clarity

Clear primary category definition
Explicit exclusions
Terminology stability
Ownership transparency
Geographic precision

Identity ambiguity increases misclassification risk.

2. Subject Authority

Cluster based architecture
Single subject discipline per page
Full prompt spectrum coverage
Definition coverage
Mechanism coverage
Diagnostic coverage
Comparison coverage

Authority is built through structured reinforcement.

3. Meaning Architecture

Layered hierarchy
Stable URL architecture
Extractable passage formatting
Structured data governance
Vector chunk optimisation

AI systems extract structure before nuance.

4. Ecosystem Validation

Business registries
Company databases
Industry listings
Review platforms
Press mentions
Professional networks

AI systems verify identity externally.

5. Signal Consistency

Terminology stability
Legacy reconciliation
Redirect governance
Temporal reinforcement
Contradiction scanning

Signal drift reduces interpretive confidence.

Platform Behaviour Differences
ChatGPT

Training weighted and narrative sensitive.

Google AI

Index and passage integrity dependent.

Perplexity

Live retrieval and citation transparency weighted.

Gemini

Knowledge Graph influenced and entity association driven.

Claude

Narrative consistency and clarity weighted.

Signal weighting differs by platform.

Measurement Philosophy

AI SEO performance is measured by:

Inclusion rate
Citation frequency
Recommendation role placement
Misclassification reduction
Interpretive stability

Not keyword ranking position.

Scope Boundaries

This framework does not include:

Paid advertising
Link buying
Traditional SEO retainers
Traffic guarantees

It governs AI search visibility and recommendation stability only.
